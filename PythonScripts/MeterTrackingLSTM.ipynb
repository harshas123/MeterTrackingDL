    "## Project Description\n",
    "In this project, we are trying to track the beats in Carnatic music using a deep learning based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The idea is to use raw T-F feautres from audio data and from this get instances where a beat should occur using LSTM network. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Details\n",
    "Ajay's hand labeled dataset - CMR_dataset_full. The dataset contains:\n",
    "1. 176 audio files\n",
    "2. Beat-level annotations \"1-8\" with their time stamp in seconds for each of the audio files\n",
    "3. Meter-level annotations (not used currently)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Partitioning\n",
    "The Entire audio data is divided into:\n",
    "1. Training Data\n",
    "2. Train-Dev Data: Same distribution as Training Data, but not used in Training.\n",
    "3. Dev Data: Part of the data has same distribution as training and a part has different distribution. \n",
    "4. Test Data: Same as Dev data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I partition the data is as follows:\n",
    "1. The entire data is first divided into two sets - Set-1: 167 files, Set-2: 9 files\n",
    "2. Training, Train-Dev and a part of Dev and Test data are chosen from Set -1 in the ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Training - 60%\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Train-Dev - 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Dev - 15%\n",
    "\n",
    "    d) Test - 15%\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: The partitioning here is such that each partition has feature vectors from all 167 audio clips. \n",
    "3. Additionally the reamining part of the Dev and Test data are chosen from Set-2 in the ratio:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a) Dev - 15%\n",
    "    b) Test - 15%\n",
    "    c) Train - 70% (Note this is part of the data is currently not used....for future if we observe that the model is not generalizing well to Dev data, this can be used)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This kind of partitioning ensures, Training and Train-Dev data have the same distribution. A part of Dev and Test Data have the same distribution as Training Data and the rest have a different distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Input features\n",
    "1. Auditory spectrogram features - 128 dimensional features obtained from a mammalian auditory model.\n",
    "2. Window length = 50ms (I had a feeling that for Music window length must be bigger than speech. Starting out with this big window...)\n",
    "3. Window Shift = 100ms. (In auditory spectrogram, typically non-overalpping features are used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A crude idea is to use a bi-directional LSTM network for classifying each frame of input data into two classes - \"Beat\" vs \"No Beat\". Trying initially with 3 layers each for forward and backward layers with 25 units each. \n",
    "1. Input - 128 dimensional\n",
    "2. Output (Softmax/Logistic) - 2 dimensional (One-Hot encoding) \n",
    "3. Number of hidden Layers = 3 (forward) + 3(backward)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notations and Convention\n",
    "1. Number of examples - m\n",
    "2. Input Dimensions - n_input\n",
    "3. Number of time steps for TBPTT for training LSTMs = n_steps\n",
    "4. Number of output classes - n_classes\n",
    "5. Number of LSTMs per layer - num_hidden\n",
    "6. Number of hidden Layers - number_of_layers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Pipeline\n",
    "1. Feature Processing + Partitioning - MATLAB (../MatlabScripts/DataPrep.m): This gives out 4 .mat files in the \"../Data/\" folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Train.mat - Training data of size 128 X m_train\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Train-Dev.mat - Train-dev data of size 128 X m_train_dev\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Dev.mat - Dev data of size 128 X m_dev\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d) Test.mat - Test data of size 128 X m_test\n",
    "This code expects audio data in: \"../Database/CMR_dataset_full/audio/\" and beat annotations in \"../Database/CMR_dataset_full/annotations/beats/\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The LSTM implementation is in this IPython notebook using Tensorflow."
